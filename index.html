            My name is Russell Pekala (russellpekala at college.harvard.edu).  I'm a junior at Harvard studying Math and Computer Science.
            I am interested in entrepreneurship and all things data (modeling, visualizing, database systems, etc.).
            Below are some of my projects. Some of them are available publically at <a href="https://github.com/russellpekala">my github</a>.

                      academic and professional environment. Additionally, I have experience doing less technical tasks
                      such as teaching and leading student organizations.

                      taking the most rigorous math, physics, computer science, and statistics classes out there.  Since
                      then I've taken easier and more practical classes while dedicating more time to projects and other activities.

                    Datamatch is a long-running Harvard tradition (80% student participation) that matches students on
                    Valentines' Day based on survey responses.  This year I spearheaded Datamatch's
                    <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/14/datamatch-pairs-2600-brown-students/">expansion</a> to other
                    schools, found consensus on policy to make Datamatch
                    <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/1/29/datamatch-gender-new-option/">inclusive</a> of nonbinary students,
                    negotiated

                    with local restuarants,
                    and got the group publicity from
                    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/13/for-just-one-day-love-is-in-the-air-amid-the-gigibytes/"> top journalistic outlets</a>.
                    Last year I founded and lead a new data visualization subteam that produced D3 visualizations of cool
                    aspects of Datamatch.  Next year I will co-lead the whole project with
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodore-liu/">Teddy Liu</a>.

                  Motivated by a sense that Harvard academics are too opaque, I scraped the Harvard Q Guide and made
                  some analyses of the data within it.  As far as I know, this project is the most compreshensive effort
                  to scrape the Q Guide out there.  A description of how to scrape the Q Guide yourself is published
                  on <a href="https://medium.com/@russell.pekala/how-to-hack-the-harvard-q-guide-b4b601d2a21c"> Medium</a>.

                    Transcriptr is a concept of a company I'd like to start.  It would buy transcripts off of students
                    and hope to use that data to tackle the problem of college recruitment being muddied by grade inflation
                    and degree signaling.

                    I worked over the summer 2016 on a Fermilab neutrino research project where I helped to optimize a
                    neural network used for automatic particle detection.  Here is a poster I created when presenting
                    my work in Washington D.C. at the National Science Foundation Student Showcase.

                    Eye to Eye is a video chat app that I built with 11 classmates in the System Design class CS96.
                    Discourse pairs people based on political differences in order to humanize people across the aisle.
                    I was in charge of working out our database needs for the project. Node/Express/MongoDB stack.

                      A hackathon project I built with Stephanie Fu and Younjin Song.  We used Amazon ML to
                      make predictions from weather data in a real-time scheduling application.
                      We won the $750 prize for the best project using Amazon Web Services.
